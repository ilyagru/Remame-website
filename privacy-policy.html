                used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your
                browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your

              </p>
              <h2>Service Providers</h2>
              <p>
                We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the
                following reasons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>To facilitate our App;</li>
                <li>To provide the App on our behalf;</li>
                <li>To perform App-related services; or</li>
                <li>To assist us in analyzing how our App is used.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These third parties may have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to
                perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they
                are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any
                other purpose.
              </p>

              <p>
                We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information,
                thus we are striving to use reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care. But remember that no method of transmission over

                reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
              </p>
              <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
              <p>
                The App may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
                third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that
                these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we
                strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these
                websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility

                not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
                children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13
                has provided us with personal information, we will immediately remove it. If you are a parent or guardian and you
                are aware that your child has provided us with personal
                information, please contact us so that we will be able to do
                necessary actions.
